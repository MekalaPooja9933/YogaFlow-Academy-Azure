Energy Activation and Kundalini Awakening:</strong> Kundalini Yoga aims to awaken the dormant spiritual energy, known as Kundalini, that is believed to reside at the base of the spine. The practice involves specific techniques and exercises to stimulate and guide this energy through the chakras, promoting spiritual awakening and self-realization.<br>
           <strong> 2.	Balancing the Chakras:</strong> Kundalini Yoga works with the body's energy centers or chakras. The practice is designed to balance and align these energy centers, fostering physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being.<br>

The combination of physical postures, breathwork, meditation, and mantra chanting is intended to create a comprehensive and transformative experience.<br>
           <strong> 4.	Stress Reduction:</strong> The practice of Kundalini Yoga often involves breathwork and meditation techniques that help reduce stress and promote relaxation. The emphasis on conscious breathing can have a calming effect on the nervous system.<br>
