      <div style="max-width:1200px; margin:auto; line-height:30px">
        <p>Mantra yoga is a branch of yoga that focuses on the repetition of mantras as a central part of the practice. Mantras are sacred sounds, words, or phrases with spiritual significance. The chanting or repetition of mantras is believed to have transformative effects on the practitioner, promoting spiritual growth, mental clarity, and a sense of inner peace. Mantra yoga is deeply rooted in ancient Indian traditions and is commonly associated with Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism.
            Here are key aspects of mantra yoga:<br>
           <strong> 1.	Mantras:</strong> A mantra is a word, sound, or phrase repeated during meditation or prayer. It is believed that the vibrations created by the repetition of mantras have a purifying and healing effect on the mind and body.<br>
           <strong> 2.	Japa Meditation:</strong> Japa is the meditative repetition of a mantra. Practitioners often use a mala (a string of prayer beads) to count the repetitions of the mantra. This process helps focus the mind and deepen concentration.<br>
           <strong> 3.	Sacred Sounds:</strong> Mantras are considered to have inherent spiritual power and are often associated with specific deities or cosmic energies. The sound vibrations of the mantra are believed to connect the practitioner with higher states of consciousness.<br>

Purpose and Benefits:</strong> Mantra yoga is practiced for various purposes, including spiritual awakening, self-realization, stress reduction, and cultivating a sense of inner harmony. Different mantras may have specific intentions or effects, such as promoting love, peace, or wisdom.<br>

           <strong> 6.	Mantra Initiation (Diksha):</strong> In some traditions, a mantra is given to a practitioner by a qualified teacher during a formal initiation ceremony known as diksha. The teacher imparts the mantra along with instructions on how to use it for meditation.<br>
           <strong> 7.	Tantric Mantras:</strong> In tantra, a branch of esoteric practices within various Eastern traditions, mantras play a significant role. Tantric mantras are often associated with specific deities and are used for both spiritual and ritualistic purposes.<br>
           <strong> 8.	Secular Applications:</strong> While deeply rooted in religious traditions, mantra yoga has also found applications in secular settings. Some people use mantras for stress reduction, relaxation, and pers<br>
