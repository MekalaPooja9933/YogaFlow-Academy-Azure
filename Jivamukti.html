        <div style="max-width:1200px; margin:auto; line-height:30px" >
        <p>Jivamukti Yoga is a modern and dynamic style of yoga that integrates physical postures, breath control, meditation, ethical teachings, chanting, and music into a comprehensive and holistic practice. It was founded by Sharon Gannon and David Life in 1984 in New York City. The name "Jivamukti" is derived from the Sanskrit words "jiva," meaning individual soul, and "mukti," meaning liberation. The practice is designed to help individuals experience spiritual awakening while promoting physical health and well-being. Here are some key features of Jivamukti Yoga:<br>
           <strong> 1.	Vinyasa Flow:</strong> Jivamukti classes typically involve a vigorous and dynamic Vinyasa flow, where practitioners move through a series of postures, coordinating breath with movement. The sequences are creative and often set to music, creating an energizing and uplifting atmosphere.<br>
           <strong>2.	Five Tenets:</strong> Jivamukti Yoga is guided by five central tenets, known as the "Five Pillars of Jivamukti Yoga." These include:<br>
           <strong>•	Ahimsa (Non-violence): </strong>Compassion and non-harming towards all living beings.<br>
           <strong>•	Bhakti (Devotion):</strong> Devotion to a higher power or the divine through practices like chanting and prayer.<br>
           <strong>•	Dhyana (Meditation):</strong> Cultivation of focused and meditative awareness.<br>
           <strong>•	Nada (Music):</strong> The use of music as a means of connecting with the divine.<br>
           <strong>•	Shastra (Scripture):</strong> Study and incorporation of yogic scriptures into one's life.<br>
           <strong>3.	Chanting and Music:</strong> Chanting is a significant aspect of Jivamukti Yoga. Classes often begin or end with Sanskrit chants, and music is integrated to enhance the overall experience.<br>
           <strong>4.	Philosophical Teachings:</strong> Jivamukti classes incorporate philosophical teachings from various yogic texts. Teachers often share insights on ethical living, the nature of reality, and the spiritual aspects of yoga.<br>
           <strong>5.	Spiritual Focus:</strong> The practice of Jivamukti Yoga goes beyond the physical postures, emphasizing the spiritual dimension of yoga. Classes may include meditation, breathwork, and other practices to deepen the connection to the inner self.<br>
           <strong>6.	Alignment and Physical Postures:</strong> While Jivamukti is known for its dynamic flow, it also emphasizes proper alignment in poses. Teachers provide guidance on alignment to ensure a safe and effective practice.<br>
           <strong>7.	Environmental and Animal Activism:</strong> Jivamukti Yoga is known for its commitment to ethical living, which extends to environmental and animal rights activism. The founders and practitioners often advocate for social and ecological responsibility.<br>
           <strong>8.	Open Classes and Workshops:</strong> Jivamukti classes are generally open to practitioners of all levels, and each class may have a specific theme. The style also includes workshops and events that allow for a deeper exploration of certain aspects of the practice.<br>
            Jivamukti Yoga has gained popularity worldwide, and many certified Jivamukti teachers offer classes, workshops, and retreats. It provides a holistic approach to yoga that encompasses physical, spiritual, and ethical dimensions, making it suitable for those seeking a well-rounded and transformative practice.<br>
